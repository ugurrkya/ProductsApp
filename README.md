# Products App


The ProductsApp mobile application consists of two screens. On the first screen, products are displayed horizontally and vertically. On the second screen, the details of the products on the main screen are shown.

- Pagination is used for the vertical products displayed on the main screen, and the products in the list are presented with 2 products per line using GridView. When the user scrolls down the list, the products of the next page will be added to the list.
- ViewPager is used for products presented horizontally. As the user swipes left and right, he will be able to see other products. In addition, the dots in the area containing the dots under the product list are also clickable.
